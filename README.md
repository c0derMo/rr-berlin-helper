# Roulette Rivals Berlin Helper

This is just a tool that helps to visually keep track of the eliminations in berlin.
It works by creating a image-overlay to put on top of the spin overlay. This overlay can be updated using the app.

To use it, just run the tool, (click a checkbox to update the file), and add the "berlin.png" to your scene.
It should fill out the whole width, and you can just align it at the very bottom of the scene.
